# week12-Bamazon

###Link to demo video [here](https://youtu.be/W_20-1BebyA)

####Technologies used:

1. Node.js
  *require 'inquirer'
  *require 'prompt'
  *require 'mysql'

2. MySQL
  *BamazonDB
  *Products Table
  *Departments Table

For this project, I created an Amazon-like storefront using the above technologies.  One of the biggest challenges for this project was getting the Node.js app to work with the MySQL database software, particularily when it involved doing things with different tables at the same time.  I wish I would have had more time to read about JOINs in MySQL because I have a feeling that would have made things a lot easier.  Overall I am very happy with my final product.  Enjoy!
